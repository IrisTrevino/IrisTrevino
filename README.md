# 🌿 Hey there!🌿 

** Software Engineer | Plant Parent | Maker | Creature Keeper**

I'm a people-oriented problem solver who happens to write code for a living. With 15+ years in IT under my belt, I've learned that the best solutions come from understanding both the technology *and* the humans behind it.

## 💚 A little about me

When I'm not architecting distributed systems or wrangling APIs, you'll find me:

🪴 Tending to my cozy home of houseplants & orchids  
🦎 Hanging out with my cuddle puddle (geckos, pacman frogs, a hognose snake, isopods, springtails, and the obligatory cats & dogs)  
🖨️ Bringing ideas to life with my 3D printer, laser cutter, and Juliet  
📔 Journaling in my Traveler's Notebook and Hobonichi  
🎮 Getting lost in Silksong 

I love creating things—whether it's code, custom stationery, or a perfectly balanced terrarium. There's something deeply satisfying about building systems that work smoothly, both in software and in life.

## 🛠️ What I work with

**Languages & Tools:** Golang • Python • PHP • JavaScript • TypeScript • React
